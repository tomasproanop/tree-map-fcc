# Tree Map Diagram - freeCodeCamp

Visualize Data with a Treemap Diagram - 5th Data Visualization Project from freeCodeCamp 

In the Data Visualization Certification, I learned to build charts, graphs, and maps to present 
different types of data with the D3.js library.

I'll also learned about JSON and how to work with data online using an API.
